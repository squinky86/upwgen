Unspeakable Random Password Generator

When passwords don't need to be spoken, why not include characters that are difficult to communicate verbally? Increasing the keysize of passwords increases their security. The Unspeakable Password Generator will allow you to generate Passwords-that-shall-not-be-named!

Upwgen works by selecting unprintable characters (using latin tags) to prevent printing out the password and rare languages (ones that are considered "extinct") to prevent people from being able to communicate characters that do print.

Including these characters in the keyspace means that the passwords can only be communicated digitally, and it encourages users to change their passwords quickly.
